// In Go, an empty interface is an interface type that has no methods. An empty interface is used to represent any value of any type, as every type implements at least zero methods.

// The empty interface is often used as a type for arguments that can have any type. For example, the fmt package in Go uses the empty interface as the type for arguments to functions like Print and Println:

// fmt.Println(42)
// fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
// fmt.Println(3.14159265)

// In this example, the Println function accepts any value of any type, as it takes an argument of type interface{}, which is the Go type alias for the empty interface.

// The empty interface can also be used as a type for a data structure that can hold values of any type, such as a generic container. For example, here is an implementation of a simple stack data structure that can hold values of any type:

// type Stack []interface{}

// func (s *Stack) Push(x interface{}) {
//     *s = append(*s, x)
// }

// func (s *Stack) Pop() interface{} {
//     n := len(*s)
//     x := (*s)[n-1]
//     *s = (*s)[:n-1]
//     return x
// }

// In this example, the stack holds values of type interface{}, which is the Go type alias for the empty interface. This allows the stack to hold values of any type.
